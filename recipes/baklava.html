        <ol>
            <li>
                In a large bowl, place the flour, make a “well,” add the hot water, white vinegar, lemon juice, and olive oil. 
                Mix well by hand until you get a shaggy dough, then knead your dough for five minutes or until smooth.
             </li>
            <li>
                Wrap in plastic, and let it rest for fifteen minutes. 
                Divide your dough into twenty-five pieces evenly. Using the pasta maker attachment, roll your dough as thin as possible while generously flouring until you see your hand. 
                Repeat this process with the remaining dough pieces. 
            </li>
