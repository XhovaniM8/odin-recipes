    <!-- Description of Recipe -->
    <p>
    <em>
        Not quite a sushi bowl, not quite a "deconstructed" makimono roll. Homemade poke is truly its own thing, and it's incredibly easy to make at home. Poke is all about the fish and its marinade first and foremost, the fancy accouterment in a bowl is always optional and secondary.
